Hikvision Player SDK usage
==========================

#01 load PlayCtrl.dll
#02 call PlayM4_GetPort()
#03 call PlayM4_SetFileRefCallBack()
#04 call PlayM4_OpenFile()
#05 waits for the callback to be called, so we know the file is indexed
#06 call PlayM4_GetFileTime()
#07 call PlayM4_GetFileTotalFrames()
#08 call PlayM4_GetPictureSize()
#09 call PlayM4_Play(port, 0)
#10 PlayM4_SetCurrentFrameNum(port, 0)
#11 PlayM4_Pause(port, 1)

The above calling sequence seems to always work succesfully (no error codes reported).

Now the problem is when we do:

PlayM4_SetCurrentFrameNum(port, frame)
real_fram = PlayM4_GetCurrentFrameNum(port)

Now in some cases real_frame != frame
